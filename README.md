Malicious browser extensions can cause a wide range of problems, often while appearing to be legitimate tools. Here are the primary ways they can harm users:

* ﻿﻿Steal Login Credentials: Capture usernames and passwords you type into websites, especially for banking, social media, and email.

* ﻿﻿Harvest Personal Information: Read your private messages, emails, and form data.

* Track Browsing History: Monitor every website you visit to build a detailed profile of your interests and habits.

2. Ad Injection (Adware):

* They can inject unwanted, malicious, or fraudulent advertisements into web pages you visit.

* ﻿﻿Create pop-up windows that are ditticult to close.
* 
* ﻿﻿Redirect your searches to paid advertising sites to generate revenue for the attacker.
* 
3. Browser Hijacking: They can alter your browser's settings without your consent, including:
  
* Changing your default homepage and search engine to a malicious or ad-filled site.
* 
* Preventing you from changing these settings back.
* 
4. ﻿﻿﻿Cryptojacking: They can use your computer's processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Monero without your knowledge, significantly slowing down your system.
  
5. ﻿﻿﻿Installing Further Malware: Some extensions act as a trojan horse, downloading and installing more dangerous malware (like ransomware or keyloggers) onto your computer.
